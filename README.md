# Paper peer — Research Paper Assistant

A conversational AI assistant for students and researchers to upload, explore, and verify academic papers through natural language chat.

---

## Project Description

Paper peer is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with LangGraph, LangChain, and Streamlit. Users upload research papers (PDF, TXT, Markdown, web URL, or ArXiv ID) into isolated sessions, then ask questions about them. The system routes each query intelligently — answering directly from paper content, searching the web for current developments, or verifying whether a claim from a paper has been superseded by newer research.

---

## Target Users

- **Students** reading and trying to understand dense academic papers
- **Researchers** who want to quickly cross-reference claims across multiple papers
- **Literature reviewers** checking whether findings or methods from older papers still hold today
- **Anyone** who wants a conversational interface to a set of documents without manual reading

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Paper Q&A** | Ask questions about uploaded papers; the system retrieves relevant chunks and generates grounded answers |
| **Claim Verification** | Ask the assistant to verify a claim — it searches the web and ArXiv to determine if the claim is current or superseded, and returns links to newer papers if applicable |
| **Web Search** | For questions about current developments or explicit search requests, live Tavily results are incorporated |
| **Direct Answers** | General knowledge questions are answered without retrieval or web calls |
| **`/btw` Command** | A side-channel for off-topic questions outside the session context. The LLM decides to answer directly or search the web. These exchanges are **not stored in session history** |
| **Multi-session UI** | Open multiple independent sessions simultaneously, each with its own paper collection and conversation history |
| **Auto Session Naming** | Session titles are automatically generated (3–5 words) from the first message using the LLM |
| **Multiple Paper Sources** | Load papers via file upload (PDF, TXT, MD), web URL, or ArXiv ID/title search |
| **Graph State Inspector** | Each assistant turn exposes an expandable JSON view of the LangGraph state for debugging |
| **Streaming Responses** | Assistant responses stream token-by-token with a cursor animation |

## How to Use

### 1. Start a session
Launch the app and a default session is created automatically. Use **New Chat** in the sidebar to start additional sessions.

### 2. Upload papers
In the sidebar, choose one of three loading methods:
- **File Upload** — drag and drop a PDF, TXT, or MD file
- **Web URL** — paste one or more URLs (one per line)
- **ArXiv** — enter a paper title or ArXiv ID (e.g. `2303.08774`)

Loaded papers are listed under "Loaded Papers" in the sidebar.

### 3. Ask questions
Type in the chat input. Example queries:
- *"What methodology does the paper use for evaluation?"*
- *"Verify the claim that encoder-decoder models are the best approach for translation."*
- *"What are the latest developments in diffusion models?"*

### 4. Use `/btw` for off-topic questions
Prefix any message with `/btw` to ask a question outside the current paper context. These exchanges are not saved to the session:
```
/btw What is the difference between RLHF and DPO?
```

## Required API Keys

All keys are loaded from a `.env` file in the project root via `python-dotenv`.

## How the Project Is Production Optimized

| Optimization | Details |
|---|---|
| **Embedding cache** | `CacheBackedEmbeddings` writes to `./embedding_cache/` so identical text is never re-embedded across sessions — reduces OpenAI API calls and latency |
| **Session isolation** | Each session gets its own Qdrant collection (`papeer_{session_id}`) and a separate LangGraph SQLite checkpointer thread — prevents cross-session data leakage |
| **Graph caching** | The LangGraph graph is built once with `@st.cache_resource` and reused across all Streamlit reruns |
| **Streaming responses** | `graph.stream()` is used with message mode so responses appear token-by-token rather than waiting for the full generation |
| **Session persistence** | `sessions.json` persists session metadata; SQLite stores full conversation state — app restarts restore the previous session seamlessly |
| **Temp file cleanup** | Uploaded files are written to a temp path, processed, then deleted regardless of success or failure |
| **Async evaluation** | The evaluation pipeline uses throttled concurrency (3 workers, 5 s throttle) to stay within API rate limits |
| **ArXiv reliability** | Claim verification uses two targeted Tavily searches (general web + `site:arxiv.org`) instead of the `arxiv` Python library, which had reliability issues |

---

## Constraints and Why

| Constraint | Why |
|---|---|
| **Max 3 query rewrites** | The RAG graph caps query rewrites at 3 retries before falling back to a plain LLM answer. Without this cap, ambiguous or unanswerable queries would loop indefinitely, burning API tokens and blocking the user |
| **Chunk size 1000 / overlap 200** | Balances retrieval precision (smaller = more focused) against context preservation across chunk boundaries. The 200-char overlap ensures sentences split across chunks are still retrievable |
| **Tavily max 3 results for `/btw`** | Keeps the context window manageable for side-channel queries that are intentionally lightweight and unsaved |
| **`/btw` exchanges not stored** | These are deliberately out-of-context questions. Storing them would pollute session history and confuse the LLM's understanding of the paper-focused conversation |
| **Session-scoped Qdrant collections** | Prevents papers from one session leaking into another. Each collection is namespaced by session UUID |
| **Claim verification uses two searches** | A general web search catches blog posts and news; an `arxiv.org`-targeted search catches academic superseding work. One search alone misses one of these two important source types |
| **`k=4` default retrieval chunks** | Balances context richness against prompt length. Too few chunks miss relevant content; too many dilute focus and increase cost |

## Evaluation

Papeer includes an automated RAG evaluation pipeline (`evaluate.py`) built on [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval).

### Metrics (threshold: 0.7)

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **Contextual Precision** | Are the retrieved chunks relevant to the query? |
| **Contextual Recall** | Does the retrieved context cover all expected information? |
| **Contextual Relevancy** | Is the context relevant to both the input and the expected output? |
| **Answer Relevancy** | Does the generated answer actually address the question? |
| **Faithfulness** | Is the answer grounded in the retrieved context (no hallucination)? |

### Running Evaluation

```bash
uv run python evaluate.py
```

- On first run, synthetic golden test cases are generated from `documents/Openclaw_Research_Report.pdf` and cached to `goldens.json`
- Results are written to `eval_results.json` with per-test metric scores, pass/fail status, and failure reasons
- Subsequent runs reuse cached goldens unless `goldens.json` is deleted
